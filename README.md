# ResearchCode
This is a Python code for simulating the safety impact of CACC degradation under spatial continuous communication interruption.
It aims to investigate the safety impact of CACC vehiclesâ€™ degradation under spatial continuous communication interruption. A mixed platoon, consisting of CACC vehicles, ACC vehicles, manually driven vehicles (MDVs), and improved MDVs with information-sending devices, is simulated with the realistic CACC and ACC model, and the intelligent driver model.
